Thanks for reading this README file.

Now that's out of the way, here's a couple things about the script for the beep piano.

You will need the 'beep' package for linux. Just apt-get install beep, and it should install (tested with Debian 7).

The next step to ensure perfect operation is to make sure that the script knows where your Python is. No, it's not in your pants. It's probably in a /bin directory somewhere. Anyway, just edit the first line with the path of your python executable.

After that, just run the script in BASH or your favorite terminal and BAM. You have a piano.
